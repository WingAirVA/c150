filename: c150-01_repaint.rgb

I suggest renaming original file: "c150-01.rgb" to "c150-01_author.rgb"

...then rename my file to "c150-01.rgb"

I am a flight sim newbie and pretty new to the repaint business too.

This is a roughly 1972 vintage factory paint scheme for the C150L...
...artwork is mostly from photo of same.

This technique for repaints is an idea I had that I wished to explore... A possibly quicker, less laborious and potentially more realistic result.

The NC150X registration number, (or American "N"-number), as I have applied to the plane is fictional. (I believe "NC" is an obsolete prefix but is still seen on older aircraft.)

I also just came up with the "FlightGear Flight School" logo, as seen on tail of this A/C.

Like the aircraft it is intended for, this repaint is an "Alpha" release.
(but this doesn't mean I promise to release another!)

Please note:
"We accept no liability for the use of this repaint. Damage to aircraft, property, (including computers), or virtual persons is solely the responsibility of the user."

Enjoy,
